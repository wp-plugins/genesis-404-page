Customize the content of the 404 Page within the Genesis Theme Framework.

== Description ==

Once installed, you can customize your 404 page's title and content in Genesis > 404 Page. 

Use [genesis-404-search] shortcode to add a search form to the page.

If you'd like to dynamically list content (ex: most recent posts), I recommend you install the [Display Posts Shortcode](http://www.wordpress.org/extend/plugins/display-posts-shortcode/) and use it in the 404 page's content.
